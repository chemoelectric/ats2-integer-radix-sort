Integer-keyed radix sort for ATS2/Postiats
------------------------------------------

Initial tests suggest this sort can be much, much faster than GNU
qsort(3), although the kinds of keys it can handle is much more
limited.

(Hopefully my tests are written correctly. They have not always been
when I was timing sorts. :) )
