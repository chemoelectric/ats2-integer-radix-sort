Integer-keyed stable radix sort for ATS2/Postiats
-------------------------------------------------

This package began as a contribution to Rosetta Code.

Initial tests suggest this sort can be much, much faster than GNU
qsort(3), while being stable as well. The keys must be of a g0uint or
g0int type, however.
